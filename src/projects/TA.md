# Introduction
My friend Chris approached me one day and asked if I wanted to join him on some sections when he walked the TA, so naturally I told him that I would come for the lot. Chris had first got the idea from our friend Josh and had mentioned it to his dad, hwo had then jokingly said he would pay for the costs of doing it, and so Chris decided to call his bluff.

The Te Araroa (TA) Trail is a walking trail that stretches 3,000km from cape Rerenga to bluff across the length of New Zealand. The MƒÅori name translates to "The Long Pathway". We did not have a large amount of time between our last exam and our first day of university, and we didn't plan on running the track, we decided to walk on the south island section of the track as it is a bit more interesting than the north.

# Planning Stage
The first step in your journey, long before our first steps was a butload of logistics, from gear buying to food drops that would allow us to stay warm, full and safe on our journey.
## Route / Food
We obviously could not carry food for the entire journey in one go, so we had to organise supply drops of food and other consumables. Most of the TA hoverer is in remote parts of the country, where access by car is impossible, and only certain locations on the route could be accessed for supply drops. To figure out what was needed in the drops, we first had to decide on what days we were doing, how long we were walking each day and which huts we would be sleeping at to figure out how much food was needed for each section so that we could be supplied with the correct amount of food for that section. Below this the spreadsheet containing all 132 of the track sections from Queen Charlotte to Bluff, and me and Chris then went through and decided on what our journey would look like.

From there we could get the number of days between each supply and in total to being planning our food. To save on costs I bought myself a dehydrator from Briscoes on sale to do some dinners. For lunch we had salami (i have a friend hwo works at Verkerks) and crackers and fro breakfast we had oats. We also had various snacks thought the day to keep our energy up. The below sheet shows

### Dehy
Dehydration is a process where water is removed from food to keep bacteria from spoiling it.
