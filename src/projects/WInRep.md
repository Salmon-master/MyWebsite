# Introduction
The rubber seal that is around the windscreen in my car had been perished since I bought the car, it was split, dry and not at all waterproof, so the car was practically unusable in the wet as the seal would leak water behind the back of my dashboard, right next to most of the electronics in the car.

This is obviously not ideal, and so after i got my car back on the road after the engine swap, I decided to order another windscreen seal, and booked my car in for an appointment with [Novus Glass](https://www.novus.co.nz), as i thought that the professionals were less likely to break the glass, and it is hard to come by.

I got a call form them halfway through the appointment however, saying that when they had taken out my windscreen, they had discoverd rust holes in the bit of the bulkhead surrounding the windscreen (see photos below).

What had been happening was the seal, due to its perished condition was letting moisture through to the bulkhead, and then the seal was just good enough to trap this moisture in the low points of the windscreen surround, and rusting these out.

I called up Craig Erikson, the man who teaches the [weekend panelbeating](https://www.ara.ac.nz/products/standalone/wpan100-weekend-panelbeating-beginners) course at ARA which I was taking, and he very nicely agreed to help me to fix the rust.

The first step was to mask off the area to protect the paint, and then clean up the area around the rust with a wire wheel back to bear metal to identify what exactly we were working with. As seen below, the water had gotten in through the main rust holes and then rusted the metal about from the back, creating more holes than were original visible.

A patch panel was then formed out of some 1 mm sheet metal using the shrinker stretcher, and the panel was then formed to the exact shape needed using a hammer and body spoon using the existing panel as a template. The rust holes were then cut out of the car, and there areas behind inspected and cleaned, and the sprayed with some black zinc to help prevent future rust.

The patch was then fitted into the hole, and given some final forming alterations using the hammer. It was then welded in place using a TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welder. A TIG was used due to the a couple main reasons:
* A TIG has a relatively small amount of heat input compared to something like a gas welding plant, which minimises warping of the surrounding metal.
* A MIG welder results in a weld that is harder to reshape with a hammer and dolly after welding.
* A TIG welder allows for more precise control over the weld pool, making it easier to create clean, strong welds.

Tack welds were then used to hold the panel in place, and the panel was then full welded into place. Along the back of the panel, where it was attached to the existing bulkhead skin, holes were punched into the panel and then the panel was plug welded to the existing skin to ensure a strong bond. The rest of the welds were butt welds, but with much more filler rod then normal so that the weld could be ground back to the original contour of the panel.

I began to grind off the weld using a belt sander, but I accidentally ground too much off in one spot and went through the panel. 5 hours of work was thrown down the gurgler in 30 seconds of overzealous grinding. To fix it would be a complete redo of the patch. I wanted to cry. However this mistake may have been a blessing in disguise as when me a craig were inspecting the panel we found that it had warped at some point during the welding process. This usually would not be a massive issue, but as it was right next to the windscreen, if the panel was misshapen it could cause problems with the fitment of the windscreen, or even worse the windscreen would fit, but there would be a pressure point which could possibly crack the screen. The glass on my car is very hard to come by, so I could not risk this. So we cut out the patch again, and redid the whole process. This time however I was much more careful with the grinding, and took my time to get the welds ground back to the original contour of the panel without going through again.
