# Introduction
The rubber seal that is around the windscreen in my car had been perished since I bought the car, it was split, dry and not at all waterproof, so the car was practically unusable in the wet as the seal would leak water behind the back of my dashboard, right next to most of the electronics in the car.

This is obviously not ideal, and so after i got my car back on the road after the engine swap, I decided to order another windscreen seal, and booked my car in for an appointment with [Novus Glass](https://www.novus.co.nz), as i thought that the professionals were less likely to break the glass, and it is hard to come by.

I got a call form them halfway through the appointment however, saying that when they had taken out my windscreen, they had discoverd rust holes in the bit of the bulkhead surrounding the windscreen (see photos below).
