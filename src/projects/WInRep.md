# Introduction
The rubber seal that is around the windscreen in my car had been perished since I bought the car, it was split, dry and not at all waterproof, so the car was practically unusable in the wet as the seal would leak water behind the back of my dashboard, right next to most of the electronics in the car.

This is obviously not ideal, and so after i got my car back on the road after the engine swap, I decided to order another windscreen seal, and booked my car in for an appointment with [Novus Glass](https://www.novus.co.nz), as i thought that the professionals were less likely to break the glass, and it is hard to come by.

I got a call form them halfway through the appointment however, saying that when they had taken out my windscreen, they had discoverd rust holes in the bit of the bulkhead surrounding the windscreen (see photos below).

What had been happening was the seal, due to its perished condition was letting moisture through to the bulkhead, and then the seal was just good enough to trap this moisture in the low points of the windscreen surround, and rusting these out.

I called up Craig Erikson, the man who teaches the [weekend panelbeating](https://www.ara.ac.nz/products/standalone/wpan100-weekend-panelbeating-beginners) course at ARA which I was taking, and he very nicely agreed to help me to fix the rust.

The first step was to mask off the area to protect the paint, and then clean up the area around the rust with a wire wheel back to bear metal to identify what exactly we were working with. As seen below, the water had gotten in through the main rust holes and then rusted the metal about from the back, creating more holes than were original visible.
