# Lucy Dreams

Lucy dreams was made for the 72 hour mini game jam 105 hosted by [ZahranW](https://zahranworrell.itch.io) and [KingW](https://kingw.itch.io). I collaborated with [Chris Watson](https://github.com/CodingPluto) to make this game using C++ and [SLD2](https://www.libsdl.org), a media/graphics libary.

## A Breif descrpition of the game

An epic jumper where you have to strategically maneuver through randomly generated cloud patterns to reach the final goal: space.
NOTE: To get to the next level, you must get Lucy (the Player) to the top of the screen. There are 19 levels, getting progressively harder.
Lucy Dreams was created for the 72 hour Dreamy Game Jam. The limitation in this Jam was every playthrough is unique. We believe we have created this through the random dispersion of clouds, while keeping the game challenging and hopefully fun.
Any difficulties or problems around the game, post a comment and we will attempt to help.
