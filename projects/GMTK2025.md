## Introduction

The game maker's toolkit (GMTK) game jam is the largest game jam in the world, where competitors have four days to build a game based on a theme announced at the start of the Jam. When my friend [Chris](https://github.com/CodingPluto), suggested putting a team together to make s submission to the jam, it sounded like a lot of fun, so a team was put together with two other developers and an artist. We did not end up making a submission to the jam. The other two devs had to pull out before the jam due to other commitments, our artist flaked on us about halfway though the jam, and then all the code broke. Nevertheless there are many takeaways from this experience, as you learn much more in failure then you do in success.

### Language and development tools
The first question asked after the idea was pitched was: What development tools should we use? Several were suggested, from game engines like [Unity](https://unity.com) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org) to langues such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) before deciding on using C++, OpenGL and a graphics library called [SDL](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/FrontPage). This was probably our first mistake.

C++ was chosen as me and Chris had both used it before, and were relatively good at it, plus C++, being a relatively low level language meant that it was pretty fast, and we could hook into utilising the graphics card using OpenGL, making the game run very fast. The downside of C++ is we had to write the game entirely from the ground up, which is a 



```Cpp
Collider::Collider(GameObject* game_object, int order, int width, int height, int x_offset, int y_offset) {
    //a random comment
    this->x_offset = x_offset;
    this->y_offset = y_offset;
    colliders_.push_back(this);
    this->width = width;
    this->heigth = height;
    position = game_object->GetPositionRef();
    order_ = order;
}
```
